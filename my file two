#Public gists are displayed publicly where people can browse new ones as they’re created. Public gists are also searchable.

#Conversely, secret gists are not searchable, but they aren’t entirely private. If you send the URL of a secret gist to a friend, they'll be able to see it.

#To learn more about gists see the linked article in our Resources section at the end of this module titled, Creating Gists.

#What are wikis?
#Every repository on GitHub.com comes equipped with a section for hosting documentation, called a wiki.

#You can use your repository's wiki to share long-form content about your project, such as how to use it, how you designed it, or its core principles.

#While a README file quickly tells what your project can do, you can use a wiki to provide additional documentation.
